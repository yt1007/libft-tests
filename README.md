# libft-tests
A set of unit tests for libft functions

## Installation
Clone the repository to your computer. Then, edit the `LIBFT_DIR` variable in the `Makefile` to point to the directory containing your libft project files.

## Running the Tests
In the repository, type:
1. `make` to run tests on mandatory functions.
2. `make bonus` to run tests on bonus functions.
3. `make all` to run tests on all functions.

## Notes
1. This test does not explicitly test for the presence of `Makefile` and `libft.h` files in your libft submission. Some tests may, however, fail if your submission folder does not contain these files.
2. It is recommended to run the tests with a `-i` flag to ignore errors and proceed with other tests if you want an overview of which tests will fail.
3. Certain tests depends on other libraries in your libft submissions.
